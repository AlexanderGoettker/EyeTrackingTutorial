This is some example experimental code that demos the use of an Eyelink system with Psychtoolbox. 

The experiment includes: 

(a) Setting up the Eyelink

(b) Performing Calibration & Validation 

(c) Performing a DriftCorrection

(d) Access to online eye position

(e) One way to readout .edf files by using an additional toolbox


In the experiment a moving target is shown across a screen that needs to be tracked with the eyes. 

You can download the whole folder and start by running the experimental exp_main file. Please note there is the need to update the experimental path !
The exp_main file will call different functions that are in the _lib folder that will perform individual functions.
