# EyeTrackingTutorial 
(by Alexander Goettker, last updated 07-24)

In this project you will find an  tutorial that teaches the basics of eye tracking analysis and an example of how to run an experiment that includes eye tracking. 

The example experimental code is in the folder 'experimental code'. Here an experiment using psychtoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/) and an Eyelink (https://www.sr-research.com/) is shown and different steps (from the calibration and validation to getting access to online gaze position) are illustrated (see more in the respective readme file). 

For the analysis, please download 'EyeMovementAnalysis.ipynb'. You can open this file in GoogleCollab and go through individual steps of a typical eye movement analysis. Please note that to run things in GoogleCollab you need a google account.
The script will access this public Github repository to download data files, that you will need for the example analysis. 

In more detail the tutorial contains: 

(1) Understanding raw data and pixel spaces and What is a visual angle and how to transform your data

(2) Basics of filtering and computing velocities 

(3) Saccade Detection 

(4) Computing basic saccade parameters

(5) Data with moving objects 

(6) Detecting pursuit eye movements 

(7) Computing pursuit eye movement parameters

(8) Region of Interest Analyses for Images

(9) Fixation patterns and fixation statistics
